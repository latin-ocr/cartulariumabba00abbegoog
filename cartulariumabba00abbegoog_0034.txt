under the N orman occupation for the restoration of the one·
time famous Religious House of Eastern (lleveland. Reinirid
is named as the first restorer, and then as the first Prior of the
restored Houae. He isdesoribed in the Memorial as having
beenan active soldier in the Conquer0r¹s service-“ miles
strenuissimus in obsequio domini sui Willelmi Nothi, Regis
Anglorum ”-and aa having turned asida from the direct line of
a journey, or march, through N orthumbria in order to visit
Whitby, where he was struck with compunction at the sight oi
the desolation caused by the ravages of “the merciless pirates,
Ingwar and Ubba‚ leaders of the Danes.” Thereis a species of
suppression here which is rather amusing. Domesday also
speaks oi the desolation caused in and near Whitby, under the
ravagos of a leader of the N ormana, and it says of 28 carucatas,
averaging probably 100 acres each, “pene omnia wasta ''-the
only exceptione being the Ohuroh-lands held by the Abbot of
York in Prestebi and Sourebi. It may have been a tacit con-
sciouaness on the part oi the memorialist which held his pen,
making him feel that it might be quite as well to leave the
immediate authors oi the nearer, or more recent, wasting
unnamed. Nay, it may very well be, even, that Reinirid
himself-“ strenuissimus miles in obsequio domini sui ’'-knew
only too much about the ravages of the Conqueror, and might
have good personal reason for compunction. Any way, he
became a monk at Evesham, and there was well trained in
monastic practice and discipline. After a space he returned
into Northumbria with the clearly conceived design of reviving
monastic religion there, and, coming eventually to William de
Perci, was well received by him, and put into a favourable
position for carrying out his pians by a grant at that baron's
hands of ‘⁴ the ancient monastery oi S. Peter the Apostle,
together with two carucatas of land in Prestebi, as a perpetual
alms.'' ln uo long time several others, like-minded with him-
self, were collected together, and the new Abbey, in some sense
cr other, become alact The precise date of the commenoed
restoration isnot known ; but, according to Dr. Young, it could
not be later than 107 8 ; ior “ in that year Reinfrid was joined
by one Stephen, who afterwards became Abbot oi York, and is
usually called Stephen of Whitby, because Whitby was the
place at which be began the monastic life.'’
