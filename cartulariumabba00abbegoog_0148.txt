³ See No. l, p. 4.

⁴see No. 1, p. 4. This is Neston on the Wold‚ or Wold Newton in
Lincolnshire, “in the northern division oi the connty, parts oi Lindacy,” '
not far from Csistor. ln No. 207, Walter de Percy states that these two
cernentes were given him by his mother “ de matrimonio sno.” His mother
was Emma de Gant, daughter οι Gilbert de Gent, by Aliae, daughter of
Hugh de Μοιιιιοιι, and no donbtbroughta considerable doner to her hus-
band ont oi tharnet Lincolnshire possessione οι her lether. In No. 210,
william de Percy, heir οι Alen de Percy, and the above-named Waltcr's
elder brother, confirma the gift oi these two carucatas by Walter. Charlton
tscitly memes the Newton here named to bathe Yorkshire place called
Wold Newton.

⁸ Walter de Percy de Rngemond, described ns “ irater mens” by Will. de
Perci, filins Alani, ιιι No. 26. See also No. 1, p. 4.

⁸ These two bovates aare οι the gift oi Robert de Argentom. See No. l,
p. 7, and No. 26.

'see No. 40, end again No. 234, in both ol which documenta Rob.
filins Will. de Aioheton (or Echetnn or Aylreton, etc.) qnitclaims and
abjures Sonth Fyling to the Abbey, and in the latter οι which, the special
object oi which is the said qnitclaim and abjnmtion, it is stated that Abbot
Richard, at Robert fitzWilliam’s special petitine, then and there before
the altar solemnly excommnnicnted all and every who might seelr to
alienate the property thns chinred and qnitclaimed to Whitby. But the
presence oi the Arohbisbop is not noted in either οι these deeda

⁸ Osbert de Baines was Archdeaoon oi York in 1140 and 1154, which
makes it nearly, or perhaps quite, certain that the Abbot Richard named in
No. 2³4 (and preceding note) is Abbot Richard 1., who died in 1175. ·

⁰ A contemporary, and probably a brother, and 11 so, a younger brother,
οι Reginald Arundel de Sneton, named in No. 102.
