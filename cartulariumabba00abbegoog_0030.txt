agraet conioal hill in Cleveland,l near Moorsom‚ which 10-
maius to tell where the marc-mot 01 118 (11811101 used to be held
—and the ‘⁴ Wapentake’' and “ Thing-stead '’ remeia 10 tell us
01 the pervading change which had come over the institutione
01 11101011 country which had been 1011810011 Oliffl'ond by its
new lords; and, in telling us 01 this, the Whitby 'lhingwala
tells us, incidentally it is true, but 8180 most emphatically,
that Whitby, under the occupation and rule 01 the Danee, was,
out 01 811 Oleveland, by far the most important and the most
frequented town, as being the 888101 all their principa] civil
and mligious procedures and observances.

But this 1801, 88 11 seems to me, is not very consistent, any
more than that of the tolerably well-established characteres
¹the hardy Northman 88 vigorous 18110018, persevering tradere,
adventamus navigatore, with the notion that the town 01
Whitby, as well as 118 monastery, lay desolate and in ruins
until the restoration 01 the Abbey in N orman times.

But the matter is placed quite beyond disputa-and my
marvel is that such a painstaking and cereful man 88 Young
undoubtedly was should have overlooked the testimony I am
about to quote—by the direct evidence 01 the Domesday
returns, which I will give as briefly 88 Ι can. The geldable
salue of the 10800101 Whitby then, with the Berewic 01
Sueten, containing fifteen carucates, but having soke also in
Fyling, Gnipe, Prestebi, Ugleberdesbi, Sourebi, Breoca, Florum,
Stachesbi, and Newham, to the extent 01 281081108108 more,
was, in the time 01 King Edward, 1112. On looking over
corresponding entries, connected with the more important
Cleveland localities‚ we find the following :-in the maner 01
Locthusum (now Lolthouse), with 4 carucates, and soke in
various other townships and parishes, amounting in 811 10
nearly 47 carucatas besides, the geldable velue was 148. Α1
Stocheslaye (Stokesley), with a manor 01 6 carucatas, and soke
of 343 carucatas more in seven other places, the velue 1880181
124. At Hoton (Hutton Rudby), with 6 carucates, aud soka
01 20 0811100108 more in other places, the sum set down is 124.
On comparison then, Whitby, with a total 01 431 0811100108, 18
saled 81 1112; Lolthouse, with nearly 51 carucates, 81 ἱ48;
