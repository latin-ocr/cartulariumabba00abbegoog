early church thus presupposed, and oi its connected buildings,
are all concealed in utter obscurity. Probably it was origi-
nally a rude, rather than merclya plain, structure3 very likely,
in the first instance, immed of split trunks of trees adjusted
side by side so as to give a partially smooth suriaco within,

with thatch oi straw or rushes, and side-lights only partially
secured hy slight lattice-work of split wood. And, no doubt,
the dwellings ior the abbess, her nuns, and the servants of the'
house, would he in accordance with the early rudeness of the
church itseli, not better hut rather worse, or more rude and
inartistic.

Still it must he borne in mind that the place was neither
unknown nor unnamed. Although discerding,as utterly without
support, Young’s ideas that “ there cannot he a doubt Whitby
wasa place of some importance under the Roman Govemment”
(conceding however, that “their coasting vessels may have fre-
quented the harbour'’), and that Dunsley Bayis the Dunum
Sinus oi Ptolemy¹-for the searcity of Roman relies at Whitby,
in common with the rest of Oleveland,is so marked as to call
for special regard,-I hold it to be a reasonable supposition
that the scafaring folk who occupied the district subsequently
to the departure oi the Romans from Britain (even if not for
some considerable time before) would not he slow to note, and
to improve, the natural advantages presented hythe harbour
as wellas the soil. In other words, I cannot hut think that
Streoneshalch‚ when Hilda availed herself oi Oswiu's picus
donation, was aheady a place not only oi some importance, hut
one in which what in these medem days is implied by the
word “prognaes” was certainly hy no means unknown. And
from other consideratione I think it was, as elsewhere remarked,
already a place oi some celebrity. For, although after the dis-
astrous battle of Haethfelt‚ in which King AEdwin lost his life,
the head of the slain monaroh was taken to York, and eventu-
ally deposited in the Churoh of St Peter, which he had himself

¹ I discard tha sunniae as to the Donum Sinus as incenset. The first
portion oi this name (Denseletae) is clearly identical with the Dun in such
place names aa Dnncsdene, Dunesford, Dunestal, Dunestone, Duuesbi, Dune-
torp, Duutune, all from Domesday, aud there is little doubt that the nameis
oi Anglian or Old English imposition.
