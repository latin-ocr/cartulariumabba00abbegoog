make tha suggested hypothesis even moderately plausible. But
it would seem to be otherwise with the supposition that pos·
sibly this sacrifice of rights, so highly priaed as were thc forest·
rights which were surrendered to Hemy, may have been made
conditionally on the erectiori of an Abbaoy in place of what
before had hoen only a Priory. It will be remarked too that
Henry's charter is an cc poet sacto one-“ et ego illos forestari
,michi et hamdibus meis.¹' Not only has the concession been
made hythe monks, but the King has already acted upon it,
by taking all the formal proceedings necessary towards consti-
tuting the foresta in question a part of the Royal foreste-
proceedings which were not reversed, it may be observed, until
the reign of John, when the reversal was affected by another
special charter (No. 191).

Whether the suggestion thus made involves or imphes the
explanation of the remarkable surrender by the Convent of all
its extensive and important forest-rights to the King or not,
must be a matter left to the consideration and judgment of
such as read these remarks and look upon them as worth enter-
taining; but there is yet another matter for notice, not entirely
unconnected, and already glanced at,¹ which may as well be
mooted here. I mean that in the existing documenta we have
many tokens 01 rearrangement of fees or of portions of sees,
sorus dependent on a change in the tenant a'a capite, others ou
possible exchange or sale, or, it may he, even on an entirely
new grant.

Thus itis quite evident that, at the date 01 the charter by
William de Perci, to which uot only his wife, Emma de Port,
hut specially his son and heir, Alau de Perci, is a party,
William de Perci himself, as 11 the case with his son Alau
quite early in Henry's reign, has become tenant 111 capite, al-
though we have uo hintes to the time or the manner in which
he had become so, or as to any consideration or compensation
made to Earl Hugh on that account. But independently 01
this, which could only have been brought about by the direct
consent and co-operation 01 thc King, we find in thc same
charter evidences 01 further change, involving similar roysl
action of evena more direct kind still In the extract from
Domesday given above wa have a notice of the manor of
