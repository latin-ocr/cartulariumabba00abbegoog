Heclrenas.¹ This measure ol consentaneity between the two
authorities, independently of the intrinsic probability that such
raids ol robbers by land end robbers by sea would surely be
made, rendere it as nearly certain as possible that, subsequently
to some such act of robbery and devastation, the community
did take a temporary refuge, and of ooume at Hackness, the

seat ol the ancient cell of the Whitby Monestery. And it
surely is not impossible, perhaps not even altogether unlikely,
that, in their absence, such a sub-grant as that specified in the
Domesdey notice, and notin the least necessarily interfering

with the hono fide and still valid original grant oi the ancient
abbey church, with its site and appartenanoee,² may have

actually been conceded, on such consideratione as those stated
a little above, or on others together with them, to the man who

was, it may be, already Abbotdesignate of York.
Up to the time ol the conqueror's decease, and taking our
information from the Memorial, from Earl Hugh's charter, from

¹1 would drav attention here to the discrepancy between the statement in
the narntive last referred to and the real facts ol the case touohing the
churoholtheeellor “monasterinm ” of Hacknessr—“Qua de caumss’ says this
writer, “ Serlo Prior et Monachi de Whitby ostenderunt Willelmo de Percy
calamitatem suam st miseriam, et petierunt illurn ut daret eis locum mmendi
apud llsoksnaa Dedit eis ecclesiam Sancte Mariae de Hesionae nt ibi
wamma monasterinm, quia in eadem villa S. Hilda Abbatissa monas·
terium eomtrumt.'' Not only, however, does the memorialist expressly
atate that Prior Reinlrid's body was buried at Haohenas—“in cimiterio S.
Petri in medio parietis contm altare,'’ and speeify ‘⁸ ecclesiam S. Petri ubi
momhi nostri Deo servierunt, obierunt et sepulti sunt,” but the Conqueror’s
confirmation aecum to the said monks ecclesiam S. Petri de Hekenesss
eotemporaneously with the gift ol the two carucatas of Royul demeare
there, and the two additional carucatas at Northield.

² Thes the site and precincts ol the ancient abbey once given to Reinirid
vere ever alimated from any ol hia successore, or that such sn attempt was
made, it seems impossible to believe. The original gram may heve in-
cluded, aud most likely did include, besides the said site, procincta aud
bussdiugs or ruins thereupon, a certain mount of territory-adjacens is not
an ἱιιῐτοοοοοι word in deeds ol gift used in description of the land which
appertained to the charoli, or what not, given—and this adjoining territory
would be distinotly chnrch land, and would remain euch as edectuelly es
the site, procincta, ete. The grant to the Abbot of York might still be
easily lnrnhhed lorth out ol landa in Soureby which were not churoh

landa.
