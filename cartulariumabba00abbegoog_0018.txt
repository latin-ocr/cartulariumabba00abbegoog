not unimportant, is true. He also remarks 1101 “0
number of the charters belonging 1ο 110 Abbey are not
to be found in this volume,'’ as 0100 1101 “this bookis
not the only Whitby Register3 for we find in Tanner’s
Noria'o (p. 632) that there was another bought at a
sale by the Earl 01 Κο01; besides others consulted by
Dodsworth. ”¹ Both these statements are also correct ;
and in the second 01 110 present volumes will be found
upwards 01 150 charters mainly derived from another
copy of the Chartulmy preserved among the“AD1>1-
TroNAn MSS.'' series in the British Museum‚ several
others also coming from original sources or from
Dodsworth's 0011000000.2 As regards the copy pur-
chased by the Earl of Kent, it has, 00 100, been found
impossible to trace it. N o clew even 10 what may

given up by the Museum copy-even when 110 exist-
ing lacunae in it are allowed for-several of theim·

possibly, or even probably, have been recovered in it.
Unhappily too much that must have been in existence

disappeared; while from entries in Dodsworth itis

² The Museum copy, which is marked “Adu. uss. 4715,” will be more
specifically dealt with in the second volume, where the conclusione arrived
01 by the editor 00 to the other possible or supposed copies assumed to have
been available by Dodsworth or the writers he copies from, will also be stated.
