Serloni fratri sno, Priori de Whitby et de Hackenaa, et
monachis ibidem Deo serv, suam omnimodo firmam pacem
teneret, neo eis ullam molestiam inferret ;” and further, that in
the desire ιο put some sensible distanoe between himself and
his brother and ιο abida within the king’s lee, Serlo begged the
king to give himself and his monks‚ in perpetual alma, six
oamoates of land in his demesne, namely, two at Hackenaa and
four in Northfeld, with all their oppurtenancea.

Now there is, I think, in this story, aa in that by the alleged
Stephen, certainly a mixture of fact and of fiction; only, that
the latter proceeds rather from misconception, or imperfect
information perhaps, than from that vein of misrepresentation
which, it seems to me, is the leading feature in the Stephon
narrative-

l. In the first place, I doubt, and on divers grounds, the
accuracy of the statement concerning Ralph de Evarley.

2. In the second, l douht tho accuraoy of the statements-
there is one preceding the extract lhave given-touching the
roysl donatione stand near Hackness

3. And in tho third, Ι doubt the statement—as it stands and
ia meant to imply-ebout the wish of William de Percy to take
all the landa and villa he had given to Whitby from his brother
Serlo.

'l'hat there was a disputo between the brothers Ι think pos-
sible, and more than merely possible ς that William de Percy
adopted the alleged line of conduct in the Priorate—Stephen's
according to the pseudo-Stephen, Reinfrid's according to the
Memorialist-preoeding Serlo’s, and again in Serlo’s, I do not
think probable. That we may he led on to think the difference
arose during the latter period, and that the pseudo-Stephon
wrongly puts it in the earlier period, I dcem to be consistent
with the facts which we are certain of, and which are such, when
taken together, aa to lead on ιο probable presumption aa to the
nature of the dispute or difference, aa well as to the facte of its
being: and to a full consideration of these matters we shall
come in due time. For the present, other matters must claim

our attention
