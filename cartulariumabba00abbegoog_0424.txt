CARTULARIUM ABBATHIAE DE wfflrrrsr. 325

marcae penitus subtraxerunt per annos octo vel circiter, tandem
humiliter supplicarunt ut dictum molendinum in loeo pristino
reticem possent, et dictem firmam, prout justum erat, solverent
imperpetuum :-quod eis concessum est, et areragia condonan-
tur, ita ut ad f. S. Martini in hyeme, A. D. mill⁰ ccc serto
decimo dictam firmam integraliter exiberent.

Qrmms mersurus, eum saepe homines dicti Alexandri
facientes le Horngarth plus quarn neeesse esset de nemore
Abbatis accipere soliti sunt, et residuum sive superfluum in
villa vendere solebant, et inde ad attachiamenta¹ citari et
amerciari, sic quievit ut dicti homines liberationem sibia
ministris Abbatis gratis accipientes, plus nec minus petentes.²
Et si defectus in facture dieti Horngarth occasione minus
liberati inveniretur, non eis imputaretur, sed talis defectus, si
defectus esset, noster erit et uon illorum. Sed eum tertium
diem inquo dictus Horngarth fieret saepe vendicarent, aliter non.

afterwards (p. 243) :-“ Among all the particulare contained inthe aforegoing
articles, nothing to me appears so extraordinary as the building a gold-mill
in that desert place where Rigg-mill now stands, the use and design of which
it is difficolt for us to understand. Whether some doting monk, pretending
to more knowledge than the rest of mankind, deluded Sir Alexander with a
notion that he had found out the philosopher'a atone, aud understood the
art of extracting gold from aorne particular metal erminoni, οι· whether
this mill was intended for the making of leaf-gold, an invention that had
been discovered only about forty years before, I leave the carious to jndge:
-But whatever was their intention, the scheme, it seems, misosrried, aad a
grem deal ef money was wasted little to the profit or advantage of Sir
Alexander.'’ The last sentence is peculiarly characteristic of the author, as
is also the note appended, there being precisely the same amount of founda-
tion for the one as for the other. 'I'he note is-“ There is a particular kind
of grey stom found in some parts of our moer, which, being fluxed, a kind
of yellow metal, very much resembling gold, is extracted therefrom 3 and
possibly some curicus monk, who was not altogether unacquainted with
Alohymy, after making this discovery, might think he could transmute
this metal into real gold.” The date of the book is 1779, and it is marvel·
lous that an author living them a shrewd man of business and of consider-
able intelligence, should bring himself to believe in the gray stone, in the
unnemed “kind of yellow metal, very much resembling gold‚'’ extraeted
from it, and found the whole romanoe on no more substantial foundation
than his own marvellous blunder between the Latin words for a wind·
mill and a gold-mill. ¹ machamata.

² The construction here is altogether defective. Probably by reading
accipiant for accipientes the necessary emendation would be made.
