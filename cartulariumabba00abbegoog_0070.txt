existing there, and possessing landa and rights, than to suppose

theold connection between Whitby and Hackness had been
lost sight of, and was now, ior the first time since 869, recalled
to mind and acted on

At least thus muchis incontestably clear—that when Domes-

· day was compiled there was land at Hackncss which was
definitely the land of St Hilda. The entry‚ among the lande
oi William de Perti, involwing Hackness is as follows :-
“Minnmnn In Hagenesse, et Sudfelt, et Evrelai sunt viii
carucatae terrae ad geldum, ubi possunt esse v carucae. Dahae
terra aunt ii carucatae in soca Wulesgrip3 et aliae sunt de t'ra
S. Hildae. Nunc habet Willelmus ibi ii carucatas et xiiii
villanos, et iiii bordarioe cum iiii carucis. Ibi iii ecclesiae et
presbiter ..... Τ. R u valebat vii libras, modo xx solidos.'’
And in the summary at the end there is this further addition
to the information thus conveyed:-“ In Sudfelt et Evrelag‚”
held by William de Porci, were “ vi carucatae,” and in “Hag-
enesae iiii carucatae.¹’ The sum thus given is ten carucatas
aa against eight specified in the earlier entry. But without
troubling ourselves with the question whether the discrepancy
iaduc to a mistake of the scribe, or to some other cause, it ia
clear that in 1086, while two carucates are still in soke oi the
Royal manerium of Walesgn'l, and two are in William de

esnotonly “Testes‚” bnt “Concessum’' In the first case he grants the
ehurch oi St Pater at Whitby, “et omniaque ad eam pertinent,” which
grant 1 look upon ae in part expanded and explained, as well aa confirmed,
hythe Obarter oi william the Conquerar (No. 184); ior, besides the Port
end its wetere, forest and foreat rights, a variety oi other privileges and
liberties ere named, only consistent with tha possession oi considerable
demaine end eeclesiastical endowments. In the second he confirma the
former gift with iuller details ae to what really and specially appertained
to the church oi St Peter, inclusive oi the port, and with tha addition of
St. Mary’· Ohurch at Hacknees‚ and a variety oi tithes and other profits
elsewhere And is is to be remarlsed in reference to “other sources oi
iniomation or deduction‚'' that the memorialist speaks with entire precision
oi just tero such perinde oi benefaction on the part of william de Persi.
His words arer “Omnes terras, possessiones, forestas, ecclesias, decimas et
libertates ques sepenominatus idern Willelmus de Porci, curn Alana de
Porci fllio suo, Monasterio de Witebi dederat inprimis, necnon tn ultimis
tenporibus ruia antequam Ierosolimam peteret’' This last clause is im-
portent ee going near to fix the date of the later and fuller donation.
