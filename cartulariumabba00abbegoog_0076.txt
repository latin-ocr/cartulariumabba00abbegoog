But before proceeding tc deduce any inierence irom this—
from whatever point of view regarded-scmewhat startling iu·
consistency between this part oi the alleged Stephen narrative
arrd the Domesday returns, it may be well to try and ascertaiu
whether disparity of date may be suggested as affordiug a pos·
sible explanation, whether more or less satisfactory or reason·
able, of the said inconsistency.

The alleged Stephen states that in 1078, the twelfth year
cf the Conqueror's reign, he assumed the monkish habit at
Whitby3 that a few days aiter, as already notioed, he was
compelled by the urgent solicitations cf Reinfrid and his
haiemity ιο assume also the Priorate, and that ultimately
(demum) he was made ιο be, through the combined pressure
oi the King and both Archbishops, Abbot instead oi Prior of
Whitby; that time having been allowed for the working oi
visible improvement in the place assigned tc them, William
de Percy became their enemy, and that pirates and robbers
attacked them3 whence originated an appeal ιο the King for
succour, the result oi which was that Lastiugham was given
them, and they began to build there; that then, they them-
selves abiding still at Whitby, on the arrival oi a suitable
opportunity sor receiving the imposition of pontifico] hands
and the benediction aa Abbot, he resolved ιο go to Laetingham
and be consecrated Abbot of that place alsc, aud that at length,
with the full approbationes the Archbishcp, this scheme was
duly accomplished. It would seem that, allowing for the
necessarily gradnal progress of improvement such as that
adverted to; for the full commencement of other work else-
where efter the wrecking of the aforesaid improvement; allow-
ing also for his appeal ιο the Kiug, and the working out of
his new plans, and obtaining the consent and approval of the
Archbishop aud others consulted; and finally, sor the conse·
cration and benediction,—we can hardly suppose sc short a
period as three or four years would suffice. lt seems nearly
imperative on us ιο ask a longer space. chever, four· years
