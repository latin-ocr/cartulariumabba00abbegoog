INTRODUOTORY chamus. xlx

Oswiu himself presided at this council, aud besides him were
present his son Alchfrid, who was also a reiguing prince; Bishops
Colman and Agilberot, each with a train of clergy3 Romanus,
the Queen’s chaplain3 the venerable James, long associated
with Paulinus; and of course the lady Hilda herself. There
is no need here ιο dwell on the issue of the Synod. It is the
fact of the Synod itself which arrests the attention and fixes
our thoughts for a moment as we proceed, helpiug us to realise
one little scene in the veritsble life and aetion of those days,
and ιο localise it as having been anacted on a stage, the seenery
of which our own eyes may be familiar with as belonging to
one of the pleasant places of modern seaside resort. ’

Nor was it only thus that Streoneshalch was a place of
importance and distinction The institution from among
whose foster-children a poet like Oaedmon (setting altogether

would be steadily brought to bear on the great objects of early
religious lif . We may doubtless, without much compunctiou,
discard the tales of Oaedmon’s strangely-timed “inspiration,’'
and John's miraculous performances, as simply due to the
legend-loving temper and quality of the times wherein the record
was compiled; but there will still remain more than enough ιο
show that good men and true were working with hrain and pen
and hand and life, and that their spirit, and will, and energy of
working were fostered and guided, as well as inspired from the
fountain-heud of Hilda’s monastery at Streoneshalch.

Hilda appears ιο have died iu the year 680, aud she was
succeeded by her royal pupil AElfleda, who, for several years
after she became Abbess, had not only the benefit of her mother's
presence and support iu the discharge of her ouerous duties, but
