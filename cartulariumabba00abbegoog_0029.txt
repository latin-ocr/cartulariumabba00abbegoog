11 seems to have been reserved 101100 even to notice, and

much 10010 10 direct attention 10, this very noteworthy and
significant name.² For there can be 00 11010 question 01 what
it was, and meant, than in the case 01 the Cheshire Thingwall,
the Shetland Tingwall 01 Dingwall, or even the lcelandic
Thingvalla 110011. As Worsaae says 01 the former, 011 Whitby
· Thingwala “allonis avery remarkable memorial 01 the Court
—or Thing-which the Northmen settlers were accustomed to

hold in close connection with their sacred offerings to their
gods.” Its site, however, is now uncertain. All we know is
that it existed, and that down to the beginning 01 the thirteenth
century certainly, and probably very much later, it was identi-
fiable.

But to us the significance 01 the name and 01 the factis not
the least lessened by the difficulty, or worse, 01 identiiying the
site. The Old English “marks’' “tythings,'' “ hundreds,''
“ frithborhs,’' had all been swept away-save only the neme 01
