vincia persolvent (lum autem de animalibus hominum de
Sueten in dicta villa de Sueten venditis fieri postulassent, huic
dictus Abbaa non adquievit.

scarus Aarrcunus Petiitque idem Alexander, pro se et ho·

metere possent absque invadiatione, quod quidem nec fuit

not allowing this ve produced our charters, but they, scrupliug some
particulare, aud finding fault with these recorda as the inventione of our
own hrains, we gave them lor answer that every single record was not so
