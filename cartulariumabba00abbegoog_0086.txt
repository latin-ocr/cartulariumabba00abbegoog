its nature and its probable acerbity-which would certainly
not be diminished by the recollection that he and his Mones·
tery had become so far important and influential—mnst all be
admitted; in the former, when we take into consideration the
strangcly loose and inaccurate way—not to say the reckless
and mythical, or the intentionelly incorrect and mendacious
way-in which the writers of such narratives as that of the
alleged Stephen and of the Dodsworth memoranda, and even
some oi the later monastic scribes,1 put their so-called history
together, there is no difficulty in accounting for such tales as
those which convey tc us all the information we possess as to
varianae between Serio and his brother, and particularly as to
the desire and attempt of the latter to take back all his former
gifts to the Monastery. On the whole, Ι entertain little doubt
that William de Perci did, for some reason or other, prese, or
perhaps force, upon his brother the resignation of the headship
of the Whitby Monastery ; and that the pressure so applied
was applied at the time he had made, and been enabled to

(p. ³12), which occurs on f. 129 oi the Strichland MS, and which would
be very valuable in elucidating our present part of the early history oi the
Abbeyif we could depend on ita statements. But when we find such alle·
gations deliberately put toward, and in the very teeth ol charter aiter
charter audone Royal confirmation after another, that Alan, son oi William
de Percy the founder, died without heir; that the Perey inheritance on his
death deseended to his brother Richard—Richard de Percy de Dunsley‚ oi
course-and to his son William arur him ; and that the said Richard “nichil
dedit nee confirmavit,” it is impossible to attach any real credit to what
may bs said in other parts of the same document as to matters about which
certain historioal knowledge must have been, at all events, much more diffi-
onlt to arrive at, and indeed not to be arrived at at all except by diligent
study and comparison oi the very documenta this scribe either never hnew
oi aa existing or never consulted ir he was acquainted with them, or
deliberately put on one side as nct worth the trouble oi examinatior. Still,
notwithstanding this, for my own part 1 fully believe that this writer is
mainly correct iu the statements he makes as tc the extent and the bound·
aries oi the lands which he says were given by William de Percy to God,
St Peter and St. Hilda of Whitby, and to his brother Serlo; aud 1 have
aought aa iar as I could to malie the view in question gocd by independent
reasoning. But, on the munds above stated, I have not chosen to appeal
ior support to the direct statements in point which this writer makes, when
his trnatw0rthiness is assailed by such rcclrless misstatemento as those

exposed in this note.
