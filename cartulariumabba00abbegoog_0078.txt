Thus the inconsistency between the statements 11 the alleged
Stephen narrative aud that 11 Domesday is seen to be only the
more glaringly aud hopelessly manifested, and it becomes more
than ever apparent how little 11 weight or credit such a story
can carry with ia And this is the more unfortunate because
it is entirely evident that a connection of some kind did exist
or had existed between the early monastic settlers at Wbitby,
or some of them, aud that other monastic community which
eventually became the Abbot aud Conventus St. Mary's at
York,

For it is not only this perplexing entry in Domesday that
indicates such a connectiou; there is the distinct statement by
Symeon of Durham that the monks 11 Wbitby, alter Reiufrid’s
death,migratcd to York, aud there set up-“ construxerunt '’—a
monastery to the honour 11 the Virgin Mary, which monastery,
at the date of the said Symeon’s thory, was strenuously
administered by the Abbot Stephen. We have seen, 11 11
would seem, insuperable objections to the assertiou that
Stephon superseded Reinfrid in the rule of the nascent Wbitby
Community 11 Religious, as made in the narrative we have had
under examination. There is, however, no apparent reason for
supposing that hs did not joiu the said community aa it is
sarad he did3 and it 11 certain that 11 111 way, 11 111 11 1
second—and the probability is both in the one way and in the
other-he was a man 11 mark. Ι mean that he had become 11
iar distinguished as a monk, that his capacity and fitness to
become 11111111 monks, or of a monastic establishment, was
clearly manifested, whether or no—and clearly, I see no reason
to doubt that-he was originally a man oi worldly position and
influence. Whether we admit the account 11 his early intimacy
with Rufus, or that 11 his ability to obtain acceas tc the
Conqueror's ear with his complaints and petitione, or not, still
11 much might be safely couceded. And granted his monastic
profession at Wbitby, his there acquired and displayed fitness
for administering monastic discipline, and his more than
possible possession of mundane interest, it 11 possible, I think,

to frama a supposition or suggestion, founded on Symeon’s
distinct allegation concaming the migratiou to York 11 the
death of Reinfrid, which may really wear some amount of
