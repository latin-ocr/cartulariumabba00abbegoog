notioed the obscurity involving the precise date oi thc death1
oi the former, and it is quite evident that hc regards thc sno·
cession oi William de Peroy as consequent on the death oi
Serlo; that, in fact, it never entered into his mind to suppose
any other sequence of events. Charlton's language is as pre·
cise as possible in delivcring the same view, and still with his
characteristic dogmatism in the affixing of detes. ‘¹ Serlo,” he
writes, “continued to preside with great reputation as Prior
in the Monastery of Whitby, for almost twenty years, and died
about the year 1102. . . . He was succeeded‚ as Prior oi
Whitby, by his nephew William.''²

Only a small measure of attention to the terms actually
employed bytho Memorialist—-the only authority I believe
either assumed or evailable by these two writers—will be suffi-
cient to prove thetis any statement of the kind is made, it is
that Serlo remaiued Prior only until he was superseded by
William as Abbot. Whether William was put over his head
in the new dignity acquired for the House of Whitby, while
be still remained in the now subsidiary post of Prior, or
whether he resigned the office altogether and ceased to bear
any prominent pert in the rule of the Housc, we may heve no
absolutely positive mounds ior deoiding3 although, as will be
more fully seen in the sequel, we are not quite without means
ior arriving at a fairly satisfactory conclusion.

¹ Whitby, pp. 253, 2⁵7.
¹ Whitby, p. 62. The author continues his statement thus :-“ Who‘ had

ior several years lived as a canon or monh there, and was unanimously
elected by the whole fraternity.” Chariton has no authority whatever ior
making the latter part oi this statement. It may bc true, or it may not,
but it rests ou uo testimony. And it is one oi a thousand others in
Charlton’s volume oi which the sams may be said As to tho former part
oi it, he orerloolrs the diffcrencc between monh and canon; he is with·
out authority for stating that ‘⁴ William de Peroy canonicus” had lived
at Whitby ior several years; aud he further overlooks the fact that will.
de Percy Canonious was still described in those terma in the time oi Robert,
son oi Fulco Dapiier son oi Reinln'd, tho Prior, or, in other words, long
alter (even according to Chariton's autocratic mode ol dating, and much
more according to the statement of the Whitby Memorialist) Abbot William
da Peroy had commencad bis period oi headship. There is very little doubt
thst william de Percy, the canon, was a brother oi Alan de Percy‚ and sou
oi william da Perey bote Lesgernuns “The Founder,” aud consequently
coudn to Abbot william. See note ³ to No. 89.
