Robert de Pothow, and others oi like date, erc eowitnesses with Itobert de
stutevill What the relatiouehip, however, between the seid Robert de
Stuteville and the William de stuteville oi No. 73, may have been, though
nowhere hinted et in the present series oi documenta, is apparentlya matter
ol tolerably direct inierence. According ιο Dugdnle,1tobert de stuteville 1.
uvas living in 1080 aud 1107 ; hirson, Robert de stuteville 11.. wus at the
bettle of the Standsrd in 1138, was assessed ιο an eid ior marrying the
King’s daughter in 1160, was sheriff oi Yorkshire 1170-1175, end uss still
living in 1177, ii not, inferentially, ior some time aiter that Robert 111,
son of Robert 11, is merely mentioned, without eny dates, us a beneisotor ot
Rievaulx; but his son Williem is named as taking an active pert in public
mettere ss early ae 1171, and es dying in 1204. Pessing by the various
difficulties and perplexities involved in this statement, and especially as col·
lsted with the statements made in reference ιο these same noblemen by
Orderic Vitnlis as not ol great (ir any) interest ιο the present inquiry, and
merely hinting in relation to them thet it is mere than probnble thet in
more then one oi the references the second end third Roberte are confoundcd
together, it remeius to be notioed thet the William de stuteville lest men-
tioned as dying in 1204-e date which tallies well enough with thet
secessurily given ιο Νο. 73‚—a direct lineel descendant, morcover, oi the
Robert de stotevill named hy Graves as grantor oi Ayton, hed two sons,
Bobert and Nicholss, by his vvife Berta‚ niece oi Renulph dc Glnnville. Oi
these, Robsrt died ep„ leaving his brother Nicholes his heir. This Robert
appesrs certainly ιο be the witness ιο the present deed, and the others
already netedas attested by him end ltoger de Bosco. Moreover, it sves
through debanna, the grenddeughter oi Nicholes just named, that the Ayton
property possed into the Wake family.
¹ 'l'he sdditional witnesses, us given iu No. 348, are Regineld de Roselle,
Radnlphus de Nevylle, Willelmus de Mauteby (Meltby)‚ Willelmus de
Towts, segerus Persona de semar, Thomas Capelianus, Walter’ de Hoten,
snd Walter) de Morton.
¹ The dedication oi Goathlend Church is ιο s. Mary, end the probability
isthat the “Eremitoriuffl oi the Fratres endowed by Henryr„ (No. 195),
snd vhe eventually commended themselves ιο Whithy with thet king’s
metim, in order ιο become ο cell oi the Abbey oi like order end habit, was
dfflllffluntuted with the ancient parochinl church. This dced must pro·
