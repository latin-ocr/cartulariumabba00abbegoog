cer-ned, would have amounted, in its execution, to the de sacto
breaking up of both copies into a series of fragments, and
reuniting them with an arbitrsry tie, with the result oi deÎ‡
stroying the identity of either copy. Rearrangement on the
principle ol juxtaposition ol documento of like character seemed
open, on the same grounds, to a similar objection. The Editor,
therefore, after mature deliberation, deemed it best to print the
Whitby copy as it stands, following it up with the additional
documento obtained from the Museum copy in due sequence,
end with those obtained from other sources next in succession,
numbering them all in order, and by aid os these numbers in
every case referring the reeder to those documenta which in
any way belonged to the same group. And, on the whole, itis
hoped that this mode will be found on experienoe to have ull
the advantages of either of the others adverted to above, so
far as feasible, without the corresponding drawbscks or disad-
vantages.
