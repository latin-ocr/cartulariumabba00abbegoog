and moreover, the desolation was merely that of the “ Holy
House’' and its adjuncts. In point 01 lect, the “Memorial 01
Βο0010011000,” already once referred to, defines the 00000-
qnences 01 the raveges 01 the Dunish host with very sufficing
precision, namely, thus :—“ Thenceforward, for two hundred
years and more, the holy service 01 the monks and pious nuns
was in thst place discontinued.”1

1 arn quite awsre that such views 00 this subject are likely
to be regarded as quite heretical Dr. Young, in so many words,
states not only that “ when the Abbey was ruined by the Danes,
the town 01 Streoneshslh shared the ssme late,” which is,I
suppose, fairly certain ; but also, thet ‘⁴ when, 01101 the lapse 01
two hundred years, the monastery was restored, the town
revived also.’' And 0 10010 recent writer takes precisely the
same view, inasmuoh as in his little book about Whitby and 110

of Streoneshalh and its monastery were destroyed by the Dones
in 867, both lay desolate for two hundred years ;’' and again,
and repostedly, thst when the town did 101110, 11 “ 01000, like
its predecessor, Streoneshslh, as a dependency on the Abbey.’'

sistent elike with common 00000, reason and experience, sud
contmdictory to 111010110οΙ 10010 and inferences patent to the
most superficial student, could 0101 have obtained credit or
