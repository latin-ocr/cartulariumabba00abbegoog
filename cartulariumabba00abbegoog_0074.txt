appellabatur, nunc autem Witebi vocatur, Willelmus de Perci,
cognomento Iesgemuns, tempore Willelmi Bostard (nothi) Regis
Anglorum ibi fundaverit Monasterium inhonore Sancti Petri
Apostoli et S. Hyldae Abbatissae, atque Reinsrido monacho de
Evesham cum sociis suis, quos sibi adquisiverat, ipsum locum
commendaverit, et primo duae carucatas terrac in Prestebi illi
tradidit’'

Dr. Young, while remarking on one page¹ that “the
lands at Whitby,” namely “the six carucatas at Prostehy and
Soureby in the manor oi Whitby‚’' “were scarcely considered
as church property, being held by the Abbot Stephen as a
vassal or tenant under the lord oi that manor‚'' at another²
makes “no doubt ’⁹ that these “lands of Presteby and
Soureby in Whitby manor are the same which William de
Percy gave to Reinfrid and his fraternity,” and more ex-
plicitly still, in a third place,⁸ adds, “The lande oi Pmstehi,
consisting oi two carucates, are obviously the same which
Willism de Percy first gave to Reinfrid and his fratemity, as
stated in the Memorial; and anto these had been added the
lands oi Sourebi (supposed to be Sneaton-Thorp), consisting of
four carucatee.'' He omits, however, to notice the'discrepancy
between the statement oi his authority, the Memorialist, as to
the nature of the gift to Reinirid—“ in elemosinam perpetuam ”
-and that of the tenure hy the Abbot of York previously
nooed by him. It would appear to me that the gift in free
alms to Reinfrid, and the grant in ordinary tenancy to the
Abbot of Yorlr, must be two distinct matters, and that the
lands concemed in either, at least most probably, must be as
distinct as the gift and grant themselves. Tbat there was a
giro to Reinfrid there cau be no doubt whatever, and, admitting
that gira, it must, in order to its validity, have been confirmed
by the tenant aa capite, or Hugh of Chester; and yet further,
admittingt the authenticity of tho said Earl's charter to Reinsrid
—and for doing so we have seen not simply weighty, but I
think conclusive, reasons-then we must also admit tnot only

the grant of the church of st. Peter but also ol “ omnia quac ad
eam pertinent,” and it will be hard, in the face of all the pre-
ceding consideratione, to limit the meaning oi this phrase so as
