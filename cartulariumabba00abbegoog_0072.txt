INTBODUCTORY CHAPI‘ERS lxv

said lands is specified‚ and by which it is formally conveyed, is
acharter of the Conqueror's, and not of his son William’s; and
second, that the charter of the latter—proved his beyond ques-
tion by the specified grant oi the church of All Saints in
Fishergate-deals with the aforesaid lands as already in the
possession of the monastery in virtue of a former grant by
another thau himself—“ de terris quas de dominio meo possid-
ent,” being the terms employed. The fact that remains, theu,
is that the lande in Hackness and N ordfeld‚ alleged by tha
unknown writer whose statements are under examination to
have been granted by Rufus, at Prior Serlo’s petition, to him and
his monastery, were not so granted by him, but had been given
by his father iu the interval between the date of the Domes-
day inquiry and that of his death And this being so, tha
doubts as to the accuracy and turstworthiness of this unknown
writer, suggested by his statements made in reference to
Radulfus de Everley, are still further provolred and greatly

But there is yet another historical misstatenrent involved in
the same narrative which still further diminishes any confi·

in reality in that of William de Perny, at a distance froin whom
and whose tenitory the petitioner for these lands is represented

stance which inevitably discredits either the writcr¹s honesty
or his qualification as a trustworthy historiari.

We have still the statements touching the desire manifested
by William de Percy to take frum his brother all the lands and
villa he had hitherto bestowed on the monastery to inquire
into; but before doing so, there are other matters which it will
be better tc pass in review and consider-matters which depend
on an entry in Domesday of such a nature as to introduce
new perplexities. Itis this:—speaking of Whitby with its
solies, these latter amounting in all to twenty-eight carucatas
liable to Denegeld, the compilet says-“ Haec habet Hugo, et
Willelmus de Percide eo. Paene omnia vvasta. Tantummodo
