But further, even if we were, not prepared ιο find charters
os confirmation by William 1., the names we meet with in this
charter-two of them (without including those of Arohbishop
Thomas sud william dc Porci) viz, Earl Alsn und Ralph
Paganel, having boen aheady met with in the Eerl of Chester's
obanter to Reiufrid—und theuso of the local neme Prostebi
would at once lead us to essign an earlier date then that of the
reign of the second William to the document; and this too, with·
out specislly noting the presence of Lsnfrauc, who died in May
1089, Earl Alan himself having died the preceding year. And
besides, the general character of the charter itself, ss well es of
that just now referred ιο as ascribed ιο Williem the Conqueror
in both chartulsnes—Oherlton says of it that it “contains as
ample and extensive privileges as it was in the power of any
English King ιο grant ''-taken in connection with the Red
King’s notorious character, is such as to make it a priori

of tbe Churoh isin the mouth cf every historiar of his timos, and their
words ere summarised in much the same terms by Freemsu, Green and
Stubbs (Nomas Goaq. v. 72, 75, 136, etc, Hiatcry cs tlte &repleb Pccpfe,

tinusnce of Lsnfrano’s life after William’s accession, his vices aud oppressione,
sacrilegicus and other, were lrept under some little restraint, though even
lanfranc himself was compelled ιο remonstrate with him on his conduct,
in respect of the Oburch among other things ; but, the Arobbishop removed,
he brebe entirely loose from sll mochone of deceucy even, and much more
of right snd respect for even the most secred claime. Such a men was not
very likely to make grant after grant to a religione house such as Whitby
then was, and indeed, except cn the ground suggested by neeman, it would
be hard ιο account for his unquesticned gift of All Saints Church at York.
