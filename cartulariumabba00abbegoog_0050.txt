accident, while assisting some workmen 11 the construction 11 1
bridge over the Dervent, 111 place called Ormesbridge.

Symeon's narrative, however meagre in its details, up to the
period 11 Reinfrid's death, is not inconsistent with all this.
He simply says that Reinfrid received those who, 11111 his
arrival st Whitby, came to him with the obJect 11 embracing a
monastic life3 adding this however 11 that point, thet 11111 his
doeth they removed 11 Yorlr, and founded there the Abbey 11
St Mary¹s, “ which,’' he concludes, “is now energeticelly 11111
by Abbot Stephen”

But Stephen's narrative would appear 11 11 irreconcilably
inconsistent with this history; indeed, directly contradictory in
some 11 its details. Before, however, proceeding to notice it
more preoisely, it may be not inexpedient to try end ascertain
whether the cherters themselves, or any among them, add any·

to Whitby in Prior Serlo'e time—which, 11 course, assumes

is little reason to doubt that copy 11 11 least one such cherter,

Prior before the year 10⁸7. But that charter, compared with other
authentia documenta, contains intrinsic evidence that it was obtained aiter
the posessione 11 the Monsstery were far more considerable than they were

Young had 111 duly examined the eridences which are available, and that it
is merely an unsnppurted assumption on his part that the possessione 11 111
