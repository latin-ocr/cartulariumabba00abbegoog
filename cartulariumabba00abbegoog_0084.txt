Tbat Reinfrid died Prior I think there can be no reasonable
doubt whatever3 that Serlo 10 Percy joined the Whitby 0001-
munity 00 0 monk during Reinfridb rule (the donation just
named being then made), seems ιο me equally little 0 matter 01
doubt ; 001 ι101 00 Reinfrid’s death Serlo de Percy succeeded
to the Priorate ean scarcely bs questioned. N or ean any great
00000 01 timebo allowed 101 the effecting of the said successione,
ss Serlo's name appears in hoth confirmations by the Conqueror.
But this 1001 testifies not only in some measure as to the date
01 which Serlo must have become Prior, it speaks also in
intelligibls terms as ιο ι10 weight and influenoe already attach·
ing to the Monastery and its aoknowledged head, independently
01 1101 belonging to the Founder, which no doubt would also be
employed in procuring such confirmations 001 grants. Nor is
it only thus that we are enabled ιο recognise the growing
importence 01 ι10 Whitby Foundstion and its Superior, 101 we
have other pregnent procis 01 110 same in important donatione
made to the Monastery, and Serlo as its Prior, by men 01

consideration 001 importunos. Such speeislly was the gift
by Uchtred de Alverstain, 111100 (1100001110 (Νο. 108), 01 two
carucates 01 laud in Ohaitun (Cayton), one 01 110 witnesses ιο
whose chartaria Serlo himself ;ι and, to specily but one other
instance, that 01 101100 10 Percy (nisce of the Founder and 01
Serlo) 001 101 first husband, Hugo de Boitorp.

Now, reference hus been made at 0 former page 10 110 distinct
statement 01 110 Μο0101101101, that Serlo de Percy continued in
the office 01 Prior until Williem de Percy, nephew 01110 Founder,
