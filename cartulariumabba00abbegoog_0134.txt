N.W.), Grenedih ia Greendyhe, Swinestischage isthe Druidical circle, Thorn-
lay is 'l'hirley (in Thirley cotes), Kirkelac is Kirhless, Coppekeldbroe is lost,
but the site is probably indicated by the name, as the highest source of the
modern hindhead broolr, the “cilium’' is strongly marked, and 'l'heofee-
dihes remeius as Thieves’ Dikes. Staincrossegate was probably not very far
from Prospeot House, near Suffield village, which remeius s'n sita. Greta
head would, it is likely, be close to Mowthorp, and then the Derwent is
reached following the course of the stream, we reach a point at its source
- scarcely a mile from Lilla Oross, whence the boundary of Whitby Liberty
is easily traced to Silhoue, and although Scograineshoues are not found now,
yet the line passas through a series of ‘⁸ hones’' before it reaches Silhoue,
and these probably are grouped together in these old bouudary tracings as
Scograineshcues. Once Lithebech or the Mirlr Esk is reached, there is no
trouble in tracing out the rest of the meres which are named iu the text.

From the next churter (No. 30) it would appear that the present charter-
was granted while Alanus, the “haeres” mentioned initurus under age, ae
also that at the dete specified init, the captivity of William King of Scot-
land (July la, 1174), he had attained his majority. He must, therefore,
have been born in 1153 or before, and allowing only twenty-one years for
the age of his father at the time oi his birth, and the came in the case of his
grandfather Uchtred, we have the birth of the latter brought to the year
