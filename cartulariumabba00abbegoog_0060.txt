But, setting aeide the preposterousness of a statement such Ino nuq irr

oially taken ιιι connection with the fact that the next superior Βξξᾞξῃ
oi the establishment‚ namely Serlo de Percy, was indisputablytoh be
Prior and not Abbot t,it will be well to give a measure of regardto sain
to the question as to who and what Reinfn'd really was Μι
Freeman, m his brief notice of the revival ol religion ιιι the
North, speaks of Reinfrid or Regenlrith as “seeminglya lay·
brother‚''¹ and adverts in a note to Symeon’s description oi
him as “ignarus litterarum,'' and on the next page goes on to
say—“ But Regenfrith, now we may presume no longer igno-
rant of letters, went forth as the reviver of the Monastery ol
Whitby.” In some way or other-perhaps owing to the mis-
oonception so easily and unsuspectedly associating itself with
the phrase, “an illiterate man’'-the idea tacitly connected
with Reinfrid seems to be that he was a common sort of a
man, and, as a soldier, just what we should speak of now-a·
days as a “ common private,'’ or one of “the rank and file.” If
the Whitby Memorialist may he assumed to have really known
something of the man he speaks of as the first Prior of the
revived Monastery, he was neither a lay-brother nor a common
soldier. He describes him aa “monachus de Evesham,'’² and
as having been “miles strenuissimus in obsequio domini sui
Willielmi Bastardi;'' aud moreover, with sufficient independence
of action to he able to turn aeide to Whitby when on his mad
-whether simply joumeying or professicnally marching-
through the province of N orthumbria. Surely the least that
can be made of such a description is that he was in some
sense or other a distinguished soldier, and in the direct service-
a personal follower-of the King himself, in contradistinction to
any other or meaner “loni” No one who bears in mind the
nature and terma of military service in those days can suppose,
when such terma are employed, that he was other than “a man

Memorial.
